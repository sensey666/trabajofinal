	abstract = {A general coefficient measuring the similarity between two sampling units is defined. The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},

	abstract = {This article proposes an alternative for single phase and low impedance parallel fault location in radial power distribution systems using the fundamentals of voltage and current measured at the power substation. This proposal is based on typical distribution systems that are unbalanced, its sections are not homogeneous and untransposed. Additionally the capacitive effect can significantly affect the behavior of a fault location method, and especially, either if it contains underground sections or the system is lightly loaded at the moment of fault.},
